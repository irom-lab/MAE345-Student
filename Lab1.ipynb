    "# Calculating Thrust Coefficient\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, we will calculate the _thrust coefficient_ and _drag coefficient_ of the Crazyflie.\n",
    "\n",
    "The force, $F_i$, and moment, $M_i$, produced by each motor is given by\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{align}F_i = k_f \\omega_i^2 & & M_i = k_m \\omega_i^2\\end{align}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, $\\omega_i$ is the rotational speed of the motor, $k_f$ is the thrust coefficient, and $k_m$ is the drag coefficient. The experimental procedure used to find $k_f$ is straightforward. Since $\\omega_i^2$ is linearly related to $F_i$ and $\\omega_i^2$ can be set to arbitrary values, we can simply measure the thrust produced at different values of $\\omega_i$ and perform a _linear regression_, which is another name for calculating the line of best fit.\n",

    "## Linear Regression Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear regression is a simple but useful statistical tool. This section will provide a quick overview of the technique in case you have not already seen it in a statistics or linear algebra class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the following scenario. We have a data set $\\{(\\mathbf{x}_i, y_i)\\}_{i = 1}^N$, where $\\mathbf{x}_i \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$ represents the input to some function and $y_i \\in \\mathbb{R}$ represents the measured output. We assume that the output is linearly related to the input and that there is some amount of additive random noise $e_i$ representing measurement error, i.e.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$y_i = \\mathbf{a}^{\\top}\\mathbf{x}_i + e_i$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal is to characterize the mapping between $\\mathbf{x}$ and $\\mathbf{y}$ by finding $\\mathbf{a}$. To do so, we first recognize that we can write the $N$ constraints given by the previous equation as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{y} = \\mathbf{X}\\mathbf{a} + \\mathbf{e}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{align}\\mathbf{y} = \\begin{bmatrix}y_1\\\\ \\vdots \\\\ y_N\\end{bmatrix} & & \\mathbf{X} = \\begin{bmatrix}\\mathbf{x}_1^{\\top}\\\\ \\vdots \\\\ \\mathbf{x}_N^{\\top}\\end{bmatrix} & & \\mathbf{e} = \\begin{bmatrix}e_1\\\\ \\vdots \\\\ e_N\\end{bmatrix}\\end{align}$$.\n",
    "\n",
    "If $\\mathbf{e}$ is known, we could simply attempt to invert $\\mathbf{X}$ to compute $\\mathbf{a}$. However, since the measurement noise is rarely known, we cannot persue this avenue. Moreover, $\\mathbf{X}$ is rarely square and / or of full rank. We often choose $N >> n$ in order to compensate for the fact that some of our measurments will have significant errors. So, instead, we will try to find a value for $\\mathbf{a}$ that tries to get \"as close as possible\" to satisfying\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{y} = \\mathbf{X}\\mathbf{a}$$.\n",
    "\n",
    "While there are a number of ways we can define \"as close as possible\" formally, the one that we are going to pick is the square of the $2$-norm of the difference between the left and right hand sides of the previous equation. This choice is made for a number of practical and analytic reasons that are beyond the scope of this class. This choice corresponds to the optimization problem\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\underset{\\mathbf{a}}{\\mathrm{minimize}}\\ \\frac{1}{2}\\|\\mathbf{y} - \\mathbf{X}\\mathbf{a}\\|_2^2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This kind of optimization problem is known as a _least-squares problem_ and is a kind of _unconstrained quadratic program_. The details of what that means are unimportant, but methods for solving these problems are very well-studied, and methods for doing so are already implemented as part of SciPy.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we are going to import the libraries and data that we need. Feel free to use any function in these libraries to help in the assignment."

Internally, the Crazyflie doesn't work in terms of commanded angular velocities for the rotors but instead in terms of a percentage of the maximum angular velocity of which the rotors are capable. Moreover, this quantity is represented as a 16-bit integer, so values range from $0$ to $2^{16}$, with $0$ corresponding to $0$% angular velocity and $2^{16}$ corresponding to $100$% angular velocity. Therefore, for the purposes of writing a controller, we are really interested in measure the value of $k_f$ for the equation\n",
