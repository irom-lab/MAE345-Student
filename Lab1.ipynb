    "The first step of designing the LQR controller for our quadrotor is to linearize the system about the hover state. The equations for the 3D quadrotor, however, are very complicated, and computing the necessary derivatives is too tedious to want to do by hand. Therefore, we will use a computer algebra system (CAS) to save us a lot of time in computing derivatives. Specifically, we will be using the [SymPy](https://docs.sympy.org/latest/index.html) package to help us along the way. If you have experience with Mathematica or MATLAB's Symbolic Toolkit, SymPy offers many of the same features but in a Python interface, and even allows us to convert the symbolic functions that we will derive into efficient numerical ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get started, we will demonstrate how to use SymPy to symbolically linearize the planar quadrotor model you worked with by hand in the previous assignment, then leave it to you to linearize the 3D model. We also suggest reading the brief tutorial given in the SymPy documentation, which will cover most of what you will need for this assignment.\n",
